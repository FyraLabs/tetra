# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues when running, developing, and deploying Tetra.

## Build issues

### `cargo build` fails with missing OpenSSL / rustls errors

Tetra uses `tokio-tungstenite` with `rustls-tls-native-roots`. Ensure you have
system CA certificates available and Rust is up to date (edition 2024 is
required).

```sh
# On Fedora / Ultramarine
sudo dnf install openssl-devel ca-certificates

# Update Rust if edition 2024 is not recognized
rustup update
```

### Module not found when building with `--no-default-features`

The `settings` module is always compiled, but everything else is feature-gated.
If you disable defaults, include the features you need explicitly:

```sh
cargo build --no-default-features --features recipes,quadlets
```

See `Cargo.toml` for the full feature list.

## Identity and TLS

### `agent-connect` fails with TLS certificate verification errors

Check that the transport config points to valid PEM files and that the server CA
is trusted:

```json
{
  "control_plane_url": "wss://dashboard.example.com/tetra/agent",
  "client_cert_path": "/var/lib/tetra/identity/agent.crt",
  "client_key_path": "/var/lib/tetra/identity/agent.key",
  "server_ca_path": "/var/lib/tetra/identity/dashboard-ca.crt"
}
```

Common causes:
- Files are missing or have incorrect permissions.
- The `server_ca_path` does not match the CA that signed the server certificate.
- The hostname in `control_plane_url` does not match the certificate SAN.

### `agent-ws-serve` refuses to bind to a non-loopback address

Non-loopback addresses require TLS. Provide both `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key`:

```sh
cargo run -- agent-ws-serve \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:7780 \
  --tls-cert /etc/tetra/tetra.crt \
  --tls-key /etc/tetra/tetra.key \
  --controller-public-key "$TETRA_CONTROLLER_PUBLIC_KEY"
```

### Host identity is not generated

The host Ed25519 identity is auto-generated on first start and persisted under
`/var/lib/tetra/identity` by default. Ensure the directory is writable:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tetra/identity
sudo chown -R tetra:tetra /var/lib/tetra
```

The `TETRA_IDENTITY_DIR` environment variable overrides the default path.

## WebSocket authentication

### Inbound connections fail with "missing controller public key"

`agent-ws-serve` requires an enrolled controller Ed25519 public key before it
will accept commands. Pass it on startup:

```sh
cargo run -- agent-ws-serve \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:7780 \
  --controller-public-key "$TETRA_CONTROLLER_PUBLIC_KEY"
```

### Commands are rejected with "stale timestamp" or "duplicate nonce"

The authenticated WebSocket protocol enforces:
- Timestamp skew ≤ 5 minutes.
- Nonce replay protection per session.

Ensure the host and dashboard clocks are synchronized (e.g. NTP). If testing
across VMs, check that guest time is correct.

### Elevation grant expires too quickly

The default elevation TTL is 30 minutes. It can be configured; if it feels too
short or too long, check the dashboard/agent configuration for the TTL field.
Elevation is intentionally cleared on Tetra restart and session disconnect where
appropriate.

## Recipe rendering

### `render` fails with "failed to read template"

Template paths in the recipe are relative to `--templates-dir`. Verify that the
template file exists under that directory:

```sh
ls "${TEMPLATES_DIR}/containers/my-app.container.tera"
```

### Rendered filenames contain literal `{{ ... }}`

Filename fields are rendered through Tera. If you see raw template syntax in the
output, the parameter key is missing from the context. Ensure:
- The parameter is declared in `parameters`.
- A value, default, or `generate` strategy is provided.

### `choice` parameter fails validation

A `choice` parameter must define at least one option:

```yaml
parameters:
  - key: protocol
    type: choice
    options:
      - https
      - http
```

### Recipe validation rejects duplicate keys

Parameter `key` values must be unique within a recipe. Check for accidental
duplicates, including parameters that differ only in `label`.

## SELinux

### Files created by Tetra are not labeled correctly

Modules that manage paths accept a shared `selinux` payload. Ensure the
controller includes it when calling actions that create or modify files:

```json
{
  "id": "cmd-1",
  "module": "samba",
  "action": "set_config",
  "payload": {
    "contents": "[media]\npath = /srv/media\n",
    "selinux": {
      "path": "/srv/media",
      "context_type": "samba_share_t",
      "recursive": true
    }
  }
}
```

If `selinux` is omitted, the module will not relabel paths automatically. You
can run `restorecon` manually afterward.

### `semanage` is not available

The `selinux` module depends on `policycoreutils-python-utils` (or the
platform-equivalent package providing `semanage` and `restorecon`).

```sh
sudo dnf install policycoreutils-python-utils
```

## Queue and backpressure

### Dashboard receives "queue full" or `429 Too Many Requests`

The bounded dispatch queue has a default capacity of 64 commands. If the host is
processing a slow mutation (e.g. large storage operation), new commands are
rejected until space frees up.

Recommended responses:
- Retry with exponential backoff.
- Avoid flooding the agent with parallel mutating requests; the queue
  intentionally serializes host mutations.

You can inspect queue depth programmatically via `DispatchQueue::metrics()` if
you are building a custom transport.

### Commands time out but still execute

The queue worker sends the response through a oneshot channel. If the caller
times out or disconnects before receiving the response, the command still ran.
Use command IDs for idempotency and reconciliation rather than relying solely on
 the transport response.

## Vsock development

### `agent-vsock-serve` does not respond

Ensure the VM guest has virtio-vsock enabled and that you are connecting to the
correct CID and port:

```sh
# Find the guest CID (host-side)
virsh dumpxml VM_NAME | grep -A4 -i vsock

# Send a command
printf '%s' '{"id":"cmd-1","module":"settings","action":"get_system","payload":{}}' \
  | socat - VSOCK-CONNECT:GUEST_CID:2048
```

The vsock listener reads one command per connection and writes one JSON response.
It is a development smoke-test, not a production transport.

## Logging and debugging

### Enable verbose logging

Set `RUST_LOG` before running Tetra:

```sh
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- agent-connect --config examples/transport.json --host-id myhost
RUST_LOG=trace cargo run -- agent-ws-serve --listen 127.0.0.1:7780 ...
```

### Dry-run before applying mutations

Most module actions support `dry_run: true`. Use it to preview changes without
modifying host state:

```json
{
  "id": "cmd-1",
  "module": "quadlets",
  "action": "install",
  "payload": {
    "scope": "system",
    "dry_run": true,
    "resources": [
      { "filename": "my-app.container", "contents": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

### One-shot local dispatch

The `agent-dispatch` CLI is the fastest way to test a module in isolation:

```sh
echo '{"id":"cmd-1","module":"settings","action":"get_system","payload":{}}' \
  | cargo run -- agent-dispatch /dev/stdin
```

Or write the command to a file:

```sh
cargo run -- agent-dispatch examples/settings.command.json
```
