# Tetra Agent Protocol

This document describes the JSON protocol used between an outside
dashboard/controller and the Tetra host agent.

The local CLI command `tetra agent-dispatch` accepts the same command envelope
that the production transport is expected to carry over outbound WSS.

For host-to-guest virtio-vsock smoke testing, `tetra agent-vsock-serve` runs a
Linux-only guest listener that accepts one raw `AgentCommand` JSON object per
connection and replies with one raw `AgentResponse` JSON object. This is a
development harness for testing the VM vsock path from the host, not the final
dashboard session protocol.

## Connection Negotiation

The production connection model is agent-outbound: each host agent opens and
maintains a connection to the dashboard/control plane. On regular hosts this is
WSS with mTLS. When the agent runs inside a VM, the same JSON frame protocol may
be carried over a virtio-vsock stream to the VM host so the VM can be controlled
from the same dashboard interface without exposing guest networking.

The repository includes an outbound WSS client via `tetra agent-connect`. The
JSON command envelope documented below is the stable application payload that
the transport carries.

Transport configuration:

```json
{
  "control_plane_url": "wss://dashboard.example.com/tetra/agent",
  "client_cert_path": "/etc/tetra/agent.crt",
  "client_key_path": "/etc/tetra/agent.key",
  "server_ca_path": "/etc/tetra/dashboard-ca.crt"
}
```

VM guest agent using host vsock CID:

```json
{
  "control_plane_url": "vsock://host:2048"
}
```

VM guest agent using an explicit numeric CID:

```json
{
  "control_plane_url": "vsock://2:2048"
}
```

Fields:

- `control_plane_url`: Endpoint the agent connects to. Supported schemes are
  `wss://`, `ws://`, and `vsock://CID:PORT`.
- `client_cert_path`: Agent client certificate for mTLS. Required for WSS.
- `client_key_path`: Private key for the client certificate. Required for WSS.
- `server_ca_path`: CA bundle used to verify the dashboard/control-plane server
  certificate. Required for WSS.

Run the outbound agent:

```sh
tetra agent-connect --config /etc/tetra/agent-transport.json --host-id host-01
```

For `vsock://` endpoints, `CID` may be numeric or one of the aliases
`hypervisor` (`0`), `local` (`1`), or `host` (`2`). VM guest agents usually use
`vsock://host:PORT`; the VM host is responsible for accepting that stream and
routing frames to the dashboard/control plane session for the matching VM.

### Recommended Lifecycle

1. `enroll`: The host is added to the dashboard inventory and receives agent
   credentials. This may be manual, QR/token based, or handled by a package
   installer. Enrollment should produce a stable host id and mTLS client
   credential.
2. `connect`: The agent opens `control_plane_url`. For WSS, it uses mTLS and
   the dashboard verifies the client certificate. For vsock, the host-side
   acceptor maps the stream to the VM inventory record before forwarding frames
   to the dashboard.
3. `hello`: Immediately after WSS open, the agent sends a small hello frame with
   agent metadata. The dashboard uses this to mark the host online.
4. `capabilities`: The dashboard sends `agent.capabilities` as its first
   command or relies on a capabilities frame in the hello response. The
   dashboard should cache the enabled module/action set per connection.
5. `dispatch`: The dashboard sends one `AgentCommand` per requested operation.
   The agent replies with the matching `AgentResponse.id`.
6. `heartbeat`: The agent and dashboard exchange pings or heartbeat frames so
   stale connections can be closed.
7. `reconnect`: On disconnect, the agent reconnects with backoff and repeats
   hello/capability negotiation.

### Transport Frames

A simple frame format is enough for the first WSS implementation:

```json
{
  "type": "hello",
  "host_id": "host-01",
  "agent_version": "0.1.0",
  "protocol_version": "2026-06-29",
  "hostname": "fedora-server",
  "os": "linux",
  "arch": "x86_64"
}
```

Command frame:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": {
    "id": "cmd-001",
    "module": "settings",
    "action": "get_system",
    "payload": {}
  }
}
```

Response frame:

```json
{
  "type": "response",
  "response": {
    "id": "cmd-001",
    "ok": true,
    "payload": {
      "os": "linux",
      "arch": "x86_64",
      "family": "unix"
    }
  }
}
```

### Host-to-Guest Vsock Smoke Test

Inside the VM guest:

```sh
tetra agent-vsock-serve --port 2048
```

From the VM host, connect to the guest CID:

```sh
printf '%s' '{"id":"cmd-1","module":"settings","action":"get_system","payload":{}}' \
  | socat - VSOCK-CONNECT:GUEST_CID:2048
```

The smoke-test listener accepts the command envelope directly, without the
outer `{ "type": "command" }` transport frame, so it matches `agent-dispatch`
and the `/dispatch` HTTP development endpoint.

Heartbeat frame:

```json
{
  "type": "ping",
  "id": "ping-001",
  "sent_at": "2026-06-29T12:00:00Z"
}
```

The matching heartbeat response can be:

```json
{
  "type": "pong",
  "id": "ping-001",
  "sent_at": "2026-06-29T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Dashboard Addressing Model

The dashboard should route commands by host id, not by network address. A
typical internal model is:

```json
{
  "host_id": "host-01",
  "display_name": "fedora-server",
  "connection_state": "online",
  "last_seen_at": "2026-06-29T12:00:00Z",
  "capabilities": {
    "modules": []
  }
}
```

When a user clicks an action in the dashboard:

1. Find the active WSS connection for `host_id`.
2. Generate a unique command `id`.
3. Send a `command` frame containing the `AgentCommand`.
4. Wait for a `response` frame with the same `id`.
5. Update UI state from `ok`, `payload`, or `error`.

If the host is offline, the dashboard may either reject the request immediately
or queue only explicitly safe operations. For host-mutating actions, prefer not
to queue commands across reconnects unless the user explicitly confirms that
behavior.

### Authentication And Authorization

Use mTLS for transport identity:

- Dashboard/server certificate is validated by the agent using `server_ca_path`.
- Agent/client certificate is validated by the dashboard.
- The dashboard maps the client certificate identity to exactly one host id.

Use command authorization separately from transport authentication:

- Only authorized dashboard users should be able to create commands.
- Dangerous actions should require explicit UI confirmation.
- Prefer a dry-run preview before sending a mutating command without
  `"dry_run": true`.
- Record the dashboard user, command id, host id, module, action, payload hash,
  and response outcome in an audit log.

The `signature` field in `AgentCommand` is reserved for signed command
envelopes. The current dispatcher only rejects an empty signature string; full
signature verification is future transport/policy work.

### Reconnect And Idempotency

Agents should reconnect with bounded exponential backoff and jitter. On each
new connection, the dashboard should treat in-flight command ids from the old
connection as unknown unless it has received a response.

Controller guidance:

- Generate globally unique command ids, such as ULIDs or UUIDs.
- Treat command responses as at-most-once from the current connection.
- Make mutating workflows explicit and visible to the user.
- Use `dry_run: true` to preview host command plans.
- Re-fetch capabilities after every reconnect.

## Protocol Contract

All requests are single-command JSON envelopes:

```json
{
  "id": "cmd-001",
  "module": "settings",
  "action": "get_system",
  "payload": {},
  "signature": null
}
```

Fields:

- `id`: Controller-generated correlation id. The response echoes this value.
- `module`: Module name, such as `settings`, `services`, or `quadlets`.
- `action`: Module-specific action.
- `payload`: Action-specific object. Defaults to `{}` when omitted.
- `signature`: Optional command signature. Empty string is rejected. Full
  signature verification is transport/policy work and is not implemented here.

Responses always have this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "cmd-001",
  "ok": true,
  "payload": {}
}
```

Errors return `ok: false` and an `error` string:

```json
{
  "id": "cmd-001",
  "ok": false,
  "error": "unknown module `missing`"
}
```

Controllers should treat a response as failed when `ok` is false, even if the
transport succeeded.

## Discovery

Use dispatcher capabilities to discover enabled modules and actions:

```json
{
  "id": "cmd-capabilities",
  "module": "agent",
  "action": "capabilities",
  "payload": {}
}
```

Response payload:

```json
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "settings",
      "feature": "core",
      "description": "Agent and host settings that are always available.",
      "status": "available",
      "actions": ["capabilities", "get_system"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Every module also supports:

- `capabilities`: Returns that module's `ModuleInfo`.
- `plan`: Returns module metadata and echoes the requested payload. This is a
  lightweight planning endpoint, not a dry-run replacement.

## Shared Conventions

### Dry Run

Mutating actions execute by default. Include `"dry_run": true` in the action
payload to return the command or write plan without changing the host.

Dry-run command response shape:

```json
{
  "command": "systemctl restart example.service",
  "status": null,
  "stdout": "",
  "stderr": "",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

Executed command response shape:

```json
{
  "command": "systemctl restart example.service",
  "status": 0,
  "stdout": "",
  "stderr": "",
  "dry_run": false
}
```

### SELinux Options

Modules that create or manage files/paths can accept a shared `selinux` object:

```json
{
  "selinux": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "/srv/media",
    "path_pattern": "/srv/media(/.*)?",
    "context_type": "samba_share_t",
    "recursive": true
  }
}
```

Fields:

- `enabled`: Optional boolean. Useful when a caller wants only `restorecon`.
- `path`: Path to relabel. If omitted, the module may use its managed path.
- `path_pattern`: Exact `semanage fcontext` pattern. If omitted and
  `context_type` is set, the agent derives it from `path`; recursive paths use
  `PATH(/.*)?`.
- `context_type`: SELinux type passed to `semanage fcontext -a -t`.
- `recursive`: Adds `-R` to `restorecon` and affects default `path_pattern`.

Actions that support this shared object include:

- `apps.create`
- `apps.update`
- `files.write`
- `quadlets.write`
- `quadlets.install`
- `storage.mount`
- `storage.configure`
- `samba.set_config`
- `nfs.set_config`
- `network.set_config`

SELinux operation responses are returned as a `selinux` array of command result
objects.

## Common Command Result

Many command-backed actions return:

```json
{
  "command": "podman ps --all --format json",
  "status": 0,
  "stdout": "...",
  "stderr": "",
  "dry_run": false
}
```

Some read actions also parse `stdout` into a stable JSON field, such as `data`,
`services`, `domains`, `domain`, `booleans`, or `file_contexts`.

## Modules

The enabled module set depends on build features. Default features currently
include `apps`, `files`, `recipes`, `selinux`, `services`, and `quadlets`.

Request payloads are plain JSON objects. Payload types shared across modules —
such as `SelinuxOptions`, `ServiceScope`, and the `apps` module's `App*`
requests — are defined in `src/types.rs` and deserialized with `serde`.

### settings

Always available.

Actions:

- `get_system`

Request:

```json
{ "module": "settings", "action": "get_system", "payload": {} }
```

Payload response:

```json
{
  "os": "linux",
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "family": "unix"
}
```

### files

Feature: `files`

Actions:

- `read`
- `write`

`read` payload:

```json
{ "path": "/etc/example.conf" }
```

`write` payload:

```json
{
  "path": "/etc/example.conf",
  "contents": "enabled=true\n",
  "dry_run": true,
  "selinux": {
    "context_type": "etc_t"
  }
}
```

`write` response payload:

```json
{
  "path": "/etc/example.conf",
  "written": false,
  "dry_run": true,
  "selinux": []
}
```

### recipes

Feature: `recipes`

Actions:

- `render`
- `render_inline`
- `context`
- `context_inline`

`render` payload:

```json
{
  "recipe_path": "schema.yaml",
  "templates_dir": "./templates",
  "values_path": "examples/nextcloud.values.yaml",
  "output_dir": "./quadlets",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

Response payload:

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "kind": "Container",
      "filename": "nextcloud-app.container",
      "contents": "[Container]\n..."
    },
    {
      "kind": "File",
      "filename": "index.html",
      "contents": "<h1>Hello</h1>\n"
    }
  ]
}
```

Recipe resource kinds include Quadlet resources (`container`, `network`,
`volume`, `pod`, `kube`) and `file` companion resources. Companion file
resources are intended to be installed through `quadlets.install.files`, under
the mutable companion-file bundle directory.

`render_inline` payload:

```json
{
  "recipe": "recipe_id: nginx-site\nname: Nginx static site\nversion: 0.1.0\n...",
  "templates": {
    "containers/nginx-site.container.tera": "[Container]\nContainerName={{ app_id }}\n"
  },
  "values": {
    "app_id": "demo-web"
  }
}
```

This action is intended for recipe bundles fetched from a remote catalog by a
dashboard or control plane. Tetra does not need to be updated when new recipes
are published, as long as the bundle uses a recipe schema the installed Tetra
version understands.

Recommended remote catalog shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "recipes": [
    {
      "id": "nginx-site",
      "name": "Nginx static site",
      "description": "Serve static files with nginx.",
      "category": "web",
      "recipe": "recipe_id: nginx-site\n...",
      "templates": {
        "containers/nginx-site.container.tera": "[Container]\n..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`context_inline` accepts the same `recipe` and `values` fields as
`render_inline`, and returns resolved parameter context without rendering
templates.

`context` payload:

```json
{
  "recipe_path": "schema.yaml",
  "values": {
    "domain": "cloud.example.test"
  }
}
```

Response payload contains a `context` object with recipe metadata and resolved
parameter values.

### quadlets

Feature: `quadlets`

Actions:

- `list`
- `read`
- `write`
- `delete`
- `validate`
- `install`
- `list_files`

Shared payload fields:

- `scope`: `"user"` or `"system"`. Defaults to `"user"`.
- `base_dir`: Optional override. Useful for tests and custom deployments.
- `files_base_dir`: Optional override for companion files.

Default Quadlet unit directories:

- User scope: `$HOME/.config/containers/systemd`
- System scope: `/etc/containers/systemd`

Default companion file directories:

- User scope: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tetra/quadlets` or `$HOME/.local/share/tetra/quadlets`
- System scope: `/var/lib/tetra/quadlets`

During `install`, companion files are written under a per-Quadlet bundle directory
derived from the first Quadlet resource name. For example, `app.container` companion
files default to `/var/lib/tetra/quadlets/app` in system scope.

Supported Quadlet filename extensions:

- `.container`
- `.kube`
- `.network`
- `.pod`
- `.volume`

`list` payload:

```json
{ "scope": "user" }
```

`write` payload:

```json
{
  "scope": "system",
  "filename": "app.container",
  "contents": "[Container]\nImage=example/app:latest\n",
  "dry_run": true,
  "selinux": {
    "context_type": "container_unit_file_t"
  }
}
```

`install` payload:

```json
{
  "scope": "system",
  "dry_run": true,
  "resources": [
    {
      "filename": "app.container",
      "contents": "[Container]\nImage=example/app:latest\n"
    }
  ],
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "index.html",
      "contents": "<h1>Hello</h1>\n"
    },
    {
      "filename": "nginx/default.conf",
      "contents": "server {}\n"
    }
  ],
  "selinux": {
    "context_type": "container_unit_file_t",
    "recursive": true
  }
}
```

`resources` are validated as Quadlet files and written to the Quadlet unit directory.
`files` are companion files written under the mutable companion-file bundle directory,
support nested relative paths, and are rejected if the path escapes the bundle directory.

`list_files` payload:

```json
{ "scope": "user" }
```

`list_files` returns all regular files under the selected base directory, including
companion files:

```json
{
  "base_dir": "/home/example/.config/containers/systemd",
  "files_base_dir": "/home/example/.local/share/tetra/quadlets",
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "app.container",
      "path": "/home/example/.config/containers/systemd/app.container",
      "quadlet": true
    },
    {
      "filename": "app/index.html",
      "path": "/home/example/.local/share/tetra/quadlets/app/index.html",
      "quadlet": false
    }
  ]
}
```

To read a companion file from the companion-file directory, include
`"companion": true` in the `read` payload.

`delete` payload:

```json
{
  "scope": "user",
  "filename": "app.container",
  "dry_run": true
}
```

### apps

Feature: `apps`

Cooks recipes into installed Quadlet-backed apps and manages their lifecycle.
An app is a named bundle: rendered Quadlet units land in the Quadlet scan
directory, while companion files and a manifest (`app.json`) live under a
per-app directory inside the companion-file data root (the same roots used by
the `quadlets` module). The manifest records the recipe source, parameter
values, installed unit filenames, and companion files so `update` can
re-render and `remove` can clean up without the caller resending the recipe.

Request payloads deserialize into the `App*` types in `src/types.rs`
(`AppCreateRequest`, `AppUpdateRequest`, `AppGetRequest`, `AppListRequest`,
`AppRequest` for `remove`), and the manifest is the serialized `AppManifest`
type. The recipe source is `AppRecipeSource`: exactly one of an inline recipe
(`recipe` plus optional `templates`) or an on-disk recipe (`recipe_path` plus
optional `templates_dir`).

Actions:

- `list`
- `get`
- `create`
- `update`
- `remove`

App names may contain letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-`, and must not start
with `.` or `-`.

`create` payload (inline recipe):

```json
{
  "name": "my-site",
  "scope": "user",
  "recipe": "id: nginx-site\n...",
  "templates": {
    "app.container": "[Container]\nImage=docker.io/nginx:alpine\n"
  },
  "values": {
    "app_id": "my-site"
  },
  "selinux": {
    "context_type": "container_unit_file_t",
    "recursive": true
  },
  "converge": false,
  "dry_run": true
}
```

A recipe can also be loaded from disk instead:

```json
{
  "name": "my-site",
  "recipe_path": "/srv/recipes/site.yaml",
  "templates_dir": "/srv/recipes/templates",
  "values_path": "/srv/recipes/values.yaml"
}
```

Inline `values` are merged over the optional `values_path` file, so recipe
defaults and per-instance overrides can ship in one call.

`create` renders the recipe, writes the Quadlet units and companion files,
writes `<bundle>/app.json`, optionally applies SELinux contexts to the bundle,
and — unless `converge` is `false` — runs `systemctl daemon-reload`, then
enables and starts the derived services. Service names are derived from unit
filenames: `.container` and `.kube` units map to `<stem>.service`, `.pod`
units to `<stem>-pod.service`; network and volume units have no service.

Response:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "version": 1,
    "name": "my-site",
    "scope": "user",
    "recipe_id": "nginx-site",
    "recipe_version": "0.1.0",
    "recipe": { "source": "inline", "recipe": "...", "templates": {} },
    "values": { "app_id": "my-site" },
    "units": ["my-site.container"],
    "files": ["index.html"],
    "created_at": 1750000000,
    "updated_at": 1750000000
  },
  "base_dir": "/home/example/.config/containers/systemd",
  "bundle_dir": "/home/example/.local/share/tetra/quadlets/my-site",
  "manifest_path": "/home/example/.local/share/tetra/quadlets/my-site/app.json",
  "units": ["my-site.container"],
  "files": ["index.html"],
  "services": ["my-site.service"],
  "systemd": [],
  "selinux": [],
  "written": true,
  "dry_run": false
}
```

`list` payload:

```json
{ "scope": "user" }
```

Returns one summary per app plus an `invalid` array naming bundle directories
whose manifest could not be read (corrupted bundles or stray unmanaged
directories):

```json
{
  "files_base_dir": "/home/example/.local/share/tetra/quadlets",
  "apps": [
    {
      "name": "my-site",
      "recipe_id": "nginx-site",
      "recipe_version": "0.1.0",
      "scope": "user",
      "units": ["my-site.container"],
      "services": ["my-site.service"],
      "created_at": 1750000000,
      "updated_at": 1750000000,
      "bundle_dir": "/home/example/.local/share/tetra/quadlets/my-site"
    }
  ],
  "invalid": []
}
```

`get` payload:

```json
{ "name": "my-site", "scope": "user" }
```

Returns the full manifest plus the unit and companion-file listings (each with
its absolute path and an `exists` flag) and the derived services.

`update` payload:

```json
{
  "name": "my-site",
  "values": { "app_id": "my-site" },
  "dry_run": true
}
```

Loads the stored manifest, optionally replaces the recipe source (same fields
as `create`, for recipe upgrades), merges `values` per key over the stored
values so previously collected secrets do not need to be resent, re-renders,
installs the new bundle, deletes units and companion files that are no longer
rendered, rewrites the manifest, and restarts the derived services when
`converge` is enabled.

`remove` payload:

```json
{
  "name": "my-site",
  "scope": "user",
  "converge": true,
  "dry_run": true
}
```

Stops and disables the derived services (failures are reported inline in the
`systemd` array and tolerated), deletes the Quadlet units, runs
`daemon-reload`, and removes the bundle directory. Volumes created by Podman
for the app's `.volume` units are intentionally preserved.

`create`, `update`, and `remove` all honor `dry_run`, which previews the file
writes and the exact `systemctl` commands without changing the host. Setting
`converge: false` skips systemd interaction entirely, which is useful for
staging files on hosts without systemd.

### services

Feature: `services`

Backed by `systemctl` and `journalctl`.

Actions:

- `list`

## Controller Guidance

1. Start with `agent.capabilities` and hide unsupported modules/actions.
2. Default destructive UI controls to `dry_run: true` for preview, then issue
   the same command with `dry_run: false` or omitted after confirmation.
3. Treat `payload.command` as diagnostic output, not as a stable API identity.
4. Prefer parsed fields such as `services`, `data`, `booleans`, and `domains`
   when present.
5. For Fedora hosts, surface SELinux configuration near path-based workflows:
   Samba shares, NFS exports, Podman/Quadlet storage, network config files, and
   generic file writes.
6. Preserve and display `error` strings from failed responses; module errors
   include command failures and payload validation failures.

## Minimal Controller Flow

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "module": "agent",
  "action": "capabilities",
  "payload": {}
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "2",
  "module": "recipes",
  "action": "render",
  "payload": {
    "recipe_path": "schema.yaml",
    "templates_dir": "./templates",
    "values_path": "examples/nextcloud.values.yaml",
    "dry_run": true
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "3",
  "module": "quadlets",
  "action": "install",
  "payload": {
    "scope": "user",
    "dry_run": true,
    "resources": [
      {
        "filename": "nextcloud-app.container",
        "contents": "[Container]\nImage=nextcloud:latest\n"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "4",
  "module": "services",
  "action": "restart",
  "payload": {
    "service": "nextcloud-app.service",
    "dry_run": true
  }
}
```
